# Game Preservation
## Slide 0
### Introduction

- We almost all played video games in our childhood
- We want to play them again

## Slide 1
### The Problem

- Only 13% of all the games ever made before 2010 are currently legally and commercially available in ths US (where the study took place)
- And that's a lot compared to the 3% of the games made before 1985 (video game industry famous crash)
- It is not AT ALL the priority of the industry

## Slide 2
### Why tho?

- Video games are now a huge part of our daily lives, but it wasn't always the case, we need to document how we got there.
- Some games or consoles shaped history, like the Space Invaders arcade introduced in Japan in 78 causing a shortage of 100yen coins, the Atari 2600 causing the market to crash and almost disappear in 83 until the release of the NES (not marketed as a game system, but an entertainement system) in 85 to save it, Steam in 2003 with the revolutionnary idea of an online game retailer, etc.
- Like all history, it is important to be able to preserve media on the long term. Even if it is just to show you children/grandchildren what you used to play when you were their age.

## Slide 3
### Physical limitations

- One of the main reason why preservation is hard is because physical devices are just hardware from their time, and thus subjects to technological obsolescence.
- Even if you have old systems and games, and maintained them to be in mint condition, the usual wear and tear is still in effect, and you can't maintain them eternally, as some component are just not produced anymore. Pins can corrode on old cartridges or reader, the little batteries used to keep the saves alive can die of old age, disc can have scratches, or disc readers can have some malfunctionning, like a laser being off axis.
- Or more annoyingly, the tech standards have change, and you need to buy specific harware to connect yout console to a screen, which won't even look good for the ones that were made with CRT screens in mind. And they will ocntinue to do so eventually, even with the standardized HDMI now, who know what will we use in 10 or 20 years?
- On top of all of that, when arriving to the generation of consoles with access to the internet, more and more games have patches or DLC, only available on the stores of the console/game company, until they eventually decide to shut them down.

## Slide 4
### Remakes and remasters

- Many companies today like to release remakes (like its name suggest, it is a complete remaking of the game to fit modern standard, like the recent Resident Evil 4 or Final Fantasy 7 ones) or remasters (read : a fresh coat of paint to run them on the latest console) of fan favorite older games. 
- But that is only a temporary solution, as when the next generation of consoles comes in, all of these re-release are still as unplayable as they were before. 
- On top of that, sometime the original IS available, but the release of the new version make the publishers take down the original one, mainly because the newer version will be more expensive than its old counterpart.

## Slide 5
### Once it is on the Internet...

- As mentionned briefly in previous parts, online storefront are the current answer to that problem for a lot of game companies, re-releasing their older games fully digitally, like Nintendo with the inscreasing amount of old console libraries available on the Switch with an online subscription
- But being online is the cause of two mains problems, the first of wich is : what if (or more realistically, when) the company's servers are shut down? Well, we're cooked, basically. Because even with all the good will in the world, some game that were only available on these platform will (legally) be gone forever, as we saw recently with the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U store shutdown.
- Another threat to preservation caused all of that, more present on modern games, is the requirement of being online, even for a simple single player game. Some games are exclusively online, like LoL, Fortnite or Overwatch 2, and in constant evolution. Even if the servers are up for all eternity, you will never be able to experience the first version of these games, ever. Other games require you to connect to the internet to launch them, because of the DRM that makes sure you really paid for the game. Same idea as the stores, when the servers go down, DRM can't be checked, and a game fully operationnal and installed on your device can't be launched legally anymore.

## Slide 6
### The life of a pirate

- Given these physical limitations, one of the best way to preserve that part of history is to rip the games, meaning that we extract the games from the physical copy to put them into a computer file, generaly a .iso (disc image). Depending on the country, the act of ripping a game may of may not be illegal, that's still a gray area
- What is pretty much illegal everywhere tho, is the act of distibruting said ripped games, thus making their acquisition and general availabilty to the historian a real challenge
- Even when available commercially on an active storefront, like the PS Store or the Xbox's Microsoft store, anything can be pulled out with little to no notice when a licensing agreement ends, some copyright expires, ownership of the games change, or anything else really.

## Slide 7
### Commandeer that ship

- Now that we have a way to preserve game way past their planned hardware life, we need to be able to play them, that's the main point of a game after all. And for that, we have the wonderful PC, able to play older games released on it decades ago with little to no tweaking, and games from all other types of hardware thanks to dedicated members of the community.
- To do that, you'll need emulators. Those softwares are simulating the hardware of the consoles to be able to play those ripped games we talked about (and other games specifically made for these consoles when they were already out of print. Yes, they exist), and for the most part, started as only little passion projects of a couple of bored devs.
- The best part is, since an emulator replicate the original hardware fully digitally, any device with enough computing power can run them, and become a retrogaming console. That's why many people decide to install custom firmware or jailbreak their consoles for it.

## Slide 8
### The serious effort

- Some really motivated people have put some effort in a big initiative : the Videogame History Foundation. Abreviated in VGHF, it was founded in 2017, inspired by the Film Foundation, and set as its mission to bring video game history back to life, and be on par with music and TV shows or movies on the representation front(documentaries and books about it).
- In New York, the Strong Museum of Play is one of the largest history museums in the United States and one of the leading museums serving families with highly interactive exhibits and programs. The Strong houses the worldâ€™s largest and most comprehensive collection of historical materials related to play. They have an entire videogame collection, exhibits on the subject, and even an online ocalled "Video Game History Timeline" where they make note of every major gaming advancement ever made.
- A few dedicated individuals can really make a change, a recent and good exemple is The Completionist, who went with his team trought the hassle of buying EVERY game on the soon to be shut down Nintendo eShop for the Wii U and 3DS, for the sole purpose of donating them to the VGHF.
  
## Slide 9
### Conclusion

- Video games preservation is hard, and it is getting harder as time goes on, because of the physical limitations of the hardware and the legal hell hole surrounding the topic.
- There are some archiving efforts in place for the historical part of the problem, but for the playing part, piracy and emulators are still the main option for a lot of gamers.
- You can participate to the effort too! By making sure your old games and your relatives' are not just throw away mindlessly while moving house, or by digitalizing all your physical copies and archiving them at home (and that is still 100% legal as of now), or even just by donating to the VGHF.
- Another option is to join the community's voice in 'pressuring' the game corporations to think of the legacy that they are leaving to the cultural world, and not just the money the next big game will make them.
